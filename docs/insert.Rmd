# Inserting columns based on overlap

If you want to insert columns from one PyRange, based on where it overlaps with
another, you can use the insert method.

It takes the arguments strandedness (`"same"`, `"opposite"` or `False`/`None`),
how (`"first"`, `"containment"`, `False`/`None`), `suffix` and `overlap_only`.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
exons, cpg = pr.data.exons(), pr.data.cpg()
print(cpg)
print(exons.insert(cpg, "CpG"))
print(exons.insert(cpg, "CpG", overlap_only=True))
```
