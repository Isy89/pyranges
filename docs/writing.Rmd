# Writing PyRanges to disk

The PyRanges can be written to several formats, namely csv, gtf and bigwig.

If no path-argument is given, the string representation of the data is written.
(It may potentially be very large.)

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.aorta()

gr.out.gtf("aorta.gtf")

print(gr[:10000].out.gtf())
```

The bigwig writer needs to know the chromosome sizes. You can fetch these using
the pyranges database functions.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
chromsizes = pr.db.ucsc.chromosome_sizes("hg19")
gr.out.bigwig("aorta.bw", chromsizes)
```

If you want to write one bigwig for each strand, you need to do it manually.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
gr["+"].out.bigwig("aorta_plus.bw", chromsizes)
gr["-"].out.bigwig("aorta_minus.bw", chromsizes)
```
