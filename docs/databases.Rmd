# Fetching gene tracks as PyRanges

PyRanges can fetch data from UCSC, GENCODE and Ensembl through the pyranges.db module.

Each database contains at least two methods, namely genes and genomes. UCSC and
Ensembl also has the method chromosome_sizes.

The genes-methods all take a boolean flag head If true, it only fetches a few hundred rows of data.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr

genomes = pr.db.ucsc.genomes()

print(genomes.head())

chr_sizes = pr.db.ucsc.chromosome_sizes("hg38")

print(chr_sizes.head())

genes = pr.db.ucsc.genes("hg38", head=True)

print(genes)
```
