# Using multiple cores

Most PyRanges and PyRle-operations can be run in parallel. Even user-made
functions can be run in parallel using the apply or apply_pair functions.

However, by default PyRanges uses no extra cores. Unless the data are reasonably
big (at least 10^7) number of intervals or the functions are very long-running,
running in parallel-mode is actually more time-consuming than single-core mode.

PyRanges uses Ray, a "flexible, high-performance distributed execution
framework" to run in parallel-mode. To start Ray in parallel-mode you need to
import and initialize Ray before importing PyRanges or PyRles.

```
import ray
ray.init()
# then
import pyranges as pr
```

Now PyRanges and PyRles is running in multi-core mode.
