# Using multiple cores

Most PyRanges and PyRle-operations can be run in parallel. Even user-made
functions can be run in parallel using the apply or apply_pair functions.

PyRanges uses Ray, a "flexible, high-performance distributed execution
framework" to run in parallel-mode. To start Ray in parallel-mode you need to
import and initialize Ray before importing PyRanges or PyRles.

```
import ray
ray.init()
# then
import pyranges as pr
```

Now PyRanges and PyRles is running in multi-core mode.

Note: By default PyRanges uses no extra cores. Unless the data are reasonably big (at
least 10^7) number of intervals or the functions are very long-running, running
in parallel-mode is actually more time-consuming than single-core mode. Also, if
the PyRanges contains a lot of text data, there is less to be gained by using
multithreading. This is due to how strings are represented in memory in Python
and Pandas. However, this is something that will be fixed in pandas2 and then
the multithreading capabilities of PyRanges will be more useful for these kinds
of data.
