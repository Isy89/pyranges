# Summarizing PyRanges

The summary-function gives a summary of the lengths of the intervals in a PyRange:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr

import pandas as pd

from io import StringIO

gr = pr.data.epigenome_roadmap()

print(gr)

print(gr.summary())
```

The column `coverage_stranded` tells you how the data looks when merging all
overlapping features (taking strand into account), and `coverage_unstranded` is
the same, but all features are merged independent of their strand.
