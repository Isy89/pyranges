# Turning Ranges into RLEs

Ranges can be turned into dicts of run length encodings with the coverage function:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.aorta()
print(gr)
print(gr.coverage())
print(gr.coverage(strand=True))
```

You can also create coverage for an any numeric value in your PyRanges:

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(gr.coverage("Score"))
```
