# Statistics: similarity between PyRanges

PyRanges can compute a normalized Jaccard-statistic (ranging from 0 to 1) to
compute the similarities between two ranges.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.data.chipseq()
gr2 = pr.data.chipseq_background()
print(gr.stats.jaccard(gr2, strandedness="same"))
```
