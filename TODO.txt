Todo:
- divide docs into parts: Rle/GenomicFeatures/stats
- docs: write about pyranges-internals
- if pyranges has Strand column, but is unstranded, explain which symbol is not "+/-"
- create by argument to cluster-method

Test:
- (hypothesis): gr.coverage() == gr.coverage().to_ranges().coverage()
- test cluster_by_id by splitting and ensuring the result is the same

General:
- add missing info to pyranges_db.ucsc.genes()

Multicore:
- test multicpu functionality locally
- make pyranges work in multicpu even if ray is started

PyRanges-db:
- fetch GWAS-catalogue

GenomicFeatures:
- (FIX): avoid .df call in tes/tss, genomicfeatures
- create pyranges random (like bedtools random)
- compute introns per transcript or per gene (Need to do in Cython - have genomicfeatures package?)
  - 1: need merge(by=id) to ensure that all exons per transcript are merged
  - 2: then need exon computation code

Possibly:
- test http://code.databio.org/AIList, see if it is faster than my NCLS-implementation

Think:
- have pyranges-compiled package? No point in sorted-nearest
- what should subset ["chr1", "."] in an unstranded PyRanges with a strand-column return? What about ["."]?
- have .strand accessor like .chromosomes? What if it has a Strand-column, but is not stranded?
